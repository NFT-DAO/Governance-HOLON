# Welcome to Gov-HOLON GitHub Training

Project Board - https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Governance-HOLON/projects/10

## Overview 

Here we aim to :

* Reduce barriers of entry to GitHub use.
* Encourage participation in NFT-DAO's Governance.
* Collaborate in developing NFT-DAO's Governance.
* Track contributions for token rewards and incentives.

These materials will iteratively develop in the course of training Gov-HOLON members over the next few weeks.
* What works will be kept and refined further.
* What does not work will be recorded as a lesson learnt.

## Sandbox 

A GitHub Sandbox Organisation is available at https://github.com/Ek-phrasis/. 

Any NFT-DAO HOLON members may request their own repos with Admin rights which they can play with and break.

## Developers

Any developers with GitHub experience are encourgaed to participate by issuing pull requests to add content or raise issues on these training materials.

## The beginning

The emphasis in the beginning will be on allowing all NFT-DAO HOLON members to use our GitHub for documenation and threaded discussion.

The current subjects are - 

* [01 Commits](01-Commits.md)

* [02-Markdown](02-Markdown.md)

* [03-GitHub-Discussions](03-GitHub-Discussions.md )

## The future

We will progress together onto the core features of GitHub  - looking at Projects, Milestones, Issues, Pull Requests etc.
