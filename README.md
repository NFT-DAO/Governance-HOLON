# NFT-DAO Governance HOLON

# Our Vision

NFT-DAO envisions an open-source composable NFT framework for all—instead of multiple point solutions only benefiting some.
NFT-DAO envisions a comprehensive NFT strategy and open-source framework that enables all users (technical and non-technical) to easily deploy industry specific tokenized asset marketplaces.

We seek an organized community effort to fully define comprehensive requirements for the penultimate NFT platform of any blockchain and build it as a Cardano asset anyone can use to build their specialized marketplaces or NFT solutions upon. 

We can build better together.
