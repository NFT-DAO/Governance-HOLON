## Practical work - Committing a file

1. Go to your repos at your organization. An GitHub organization is typically contains all the repos a company or project is working on.

2. And find a short word document or pdf you have worked on and select all the text and copy it to the clipboard.

3. Then click on the little pencil on the first page of the repo (called a README.md page). The .md extension stands for Markdown.

4. This will open an edit file page. Paste all the text you have coped from your document into this page. Don't worry how it looks at this stage.

5. Now scroll to the bottom of the page and you will see a Commit Changes section with two dialog boxes

6. Type a title for the text you pasted in the top dialog box

7. Type some comments in the bottom dialog box

8. Then press the green "Commit Changes" button.

9. This will return you to the README.md page - but with the text you have added (don't worry what it looks like).

10. Now look to the top left and you will see a "contributor" link. This tells you how many people are contributing to this file. If you click on it - it will pop a dialog with your name as one of the contributors.

11. Now to the top right is a "History" link. If you click on that - it will bring up a list of all the changes you have made to the file. These changes are called "commits".

12. Each "commit" will have the title you gave it and you can go back to any point in time to an earlier commit.

13. If you click on the top commit - it will display what changes you have made. And you can also add comments underneath these changes.

14. To return to the main file click on the three dots on the top right and then click on "view file".

15. This takes you to a view of a particular commit or state of the file - indicated by a grey box with the commit number code in it Why it works this way - we will get to later on.

16. For the moment click on the grey box and select "main" from where it says "branches"

17. This will take you to the "main" branch of the file from where you can start editing again.
